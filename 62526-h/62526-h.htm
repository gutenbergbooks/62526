<h2 class="nobreak">REMARKS<br />

BY<br />

HON. LOGAN H. ROOTS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Speaker</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The sad subject occupying the attention of this
honorable body is one that bears upon my mind with
peculiar force. I was personally acquainted with
<span class="smcap">James Hinds</span> during a busy portion of his eventful life,
and it was in the district that I have the honor to
represent in which he met his terrible death by
political assassination.</p>

<p>His life, though short, was long enough for many
hundreds to have become so endeared as to have wished
it longer. His life, though short, was long enough to
afford a wonderfully instructive lesson of encouragement
to all those in this crowded world struggling
against the barriers of poverty. Its history is an account
of the child of poverty, developed into the honored
man by its own exertions. Its history recounts
what mighty results may be accomplished on no
other capital than a clear intellect under the impetus
of an indomitable will. Generally, when one falls so
young the exclamation is, &#8220;Oh! what might have
been.&#8221; In this instance imagination might feast itself
on such a theme <i>ad libitum</i>; but that is not necessary,
it is grand enough to say, &#8220;See what was!&#8221;</p>

<p>Only twenty years ago <span class="smcap">James Hinds</span> was a fatherless,
penniless lad. But so determined was he to acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
knowledge that he attended school when he only did
so by hiring a room, doing his own housekeeping, and
working enough beside outside of school hours to earn
the means of paying for his school expenses and daily
living. Such earnest perseverance created success even
under the most lowering clouds of adversity.</p>

<p>Traveling by such rugged steps he did not come
upon the stage of manhood a mere hot-house production
of opulence, but an earnest, laborious youth, gradually
developed into a self-made, self-reliant man. Experience
taught him to never wait for the coming of success
or friends, but first make success, and then friends
would come. His nature and training alike rendered
it equally impossible for him to play sycophant to the
rich or oppressor to the poor. His warm sympathy
with the oppressed and downtrodden touched a responsive
chord in men&#8217;s hearts that returned him in a
remarkable degree the affection of the masses. The
humblest and most friendless loved him without fear
of being repulsed, and learned to regard him as their
especial champion.</p>

<p>When the great struggle came between human oppression
and the nation&#8217;s life, he was at once found
positively on the side of his country, and he went forth
to do battle upon the side of loyalty, of freedom, and
justice to humanity.</p>

<p>It is now, though, nearly four years since the happy
moment arrived when he considered the struggle ended.
We all proudly felt that henceforth free speech and
free men were to be as universal south of Mason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Dixon&#8217;s line as they long had been north. It was at
that happy period that Mr. <span class="smcap">Hinds</span> was allured by the
genial clime and inviting features of the Southwest to
make his home in Arkansas, and engaged in the
practice of his profession with an assiduity that received
merited success.</p>

<p>Alas! it was not long until the fact was developed
that the fierce fires built on human oppression to destroy
and keep destroyed the relations of the State to
the nation were not extinguished, but only smoldering;
compressed and changed, but not abated. When this
fact was developed, and the question arose as to
whether or not Arkansas should make an effort to regain
her lost sisterhood in the great family of States, notwithstanding
the odium and dangers with which those who
had severed the State from her proper relations cast
about such a course, <span class="smcap">James Hinds</span> became an earnest
advocate of her return to the loyal household. Elected
to the Constitutional Convention by one of the largest
majorities in the State, he soon became recognized as
one of the prominent leaders, and to him the humble,
toiling citizen of that State owes a debt of gratitude
he can never repay; for in the construction of the
fundamental law of the State he was most active in the
introduction and riveting of those points which are
barriers of protection for the many weak against the
few strong, and for the securing to the humblest all
the rights of citizenship granted to the proudest.</p>

<p>After the adjournment of the convention and the
submittal of its work to the people, he was elected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a remarkably large vote to a seat in this body, and
even in the brief period of his presence here he exhibited
a lively interest in the welfare of the State and
indefatigable efforts to promote her good without failing
to strive for the greatest weal of the whole nation.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the closing of the summer session
he went to his home and entered vigorously into the
canvass for freedom, peace, and prosperity against
caste, oppression, revolution, and murder. I know,
sirs, many of you may think that the party which Mr.
<span class="smcap">Hinds</span> opposed was equally anxious for peace with the
party whose principles he espoused. That might have
been the case in other places, but in Arkansas, at least,
their acts showed that the Republican party advocated
peace with a desire that the beloved white-winged
spirit of peace might settle and abide in the land. But
when the Democracy did for a moment advocate peace,
their desire seemed to be for pieces of Radical skulls.
To advocate real peace was not entering upon a holiday
pleasure excursion, but was to brave death and
tread on the very verge of eternity. All this <span class="smcap">James
Hinds</span> knew, yet faltered not. A few days before his
death he wrote to a friend:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We must win the election, stand a fight, or leave the State, and it is
sad to think that many of our number, perhaps myself included, must be
murdered before seeing the ides of November, to know whether we win,
fight, or leave.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the day of his murder he was in a county which
he considered less dangerous than some through which
he had traversed, and he so expressed himself, but
added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;With men all over the country bound by terrible oaths to take Radical
lives, we do not know where there is any safety. Oh! it is terrible.
But it may be that it is all for the best, for they say the &#8216;blood of the martyr
is the seed of the church,&#8217; and it may be that the loyal blood now
drenching this land will arouse those criminally timid men who had the
power and withheld the grant of arms to our State authorities, and arouse
the patriotic masses to realize it is the nation&#8217;s duty to protect the nation&#8217;s
citizens.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh! little did he think at that moment that ere the
sunlight of that beautiful October day should give way
to the cold dew of night his own soul would be driven
from his body by the cold damp of death. He was
traveling with Hon. Joseph Brooks, another tried and
valiant soldier in the great cause of freedom and equal
rights. They were to speak that day about six miles
from the village of Indian Bay. They had been refused
passage on a steamboat because they were Radicals,
and so were belated. Some hundreds of eager,
expectant Republicans were awaiting their arrival.
To this meeting the officers of the Democratic club
had gone as advocates of the adoption of &#8220;joint peace
resolutions.&#8221; The Republicans said that several Radicals
had then recently been killed in the county and
no Democrats; and therefore they thought if the Democracy
had suddenly acquired a desire for peace no
resolutions were necessary; but although some of them
thought it merely a cloak for Democratic villany, they
were willing to bind themselves in resolutions to do
what they intended doing anyhow, and they therefore
unanimously adopted the resolutions. One of the
principle signers and most apparently earnest advocates
was George W. Clark, secretary of the Democratic
club. But as soon as he had signed them he returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to his home, arriving there before Messrs Brooks and
<span class="smcap">Hinds</span> had reached that far, and himself gave the fated
ones direction as to the road. When they had ridden
on he got his gun, saddled his horse, and rode after
them. The intended victims were riding along with
their greatest solicitude at the moment, being anxious
though to reach the waiting crowd. The horses
being differently gaited, Mr. Brooks was at the moment
some fifty yards ahead. The man with grayish
suit on rode up near, but a very little in the rear of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hinds</span>, smiling as Judas may have smiled when
he kissed his Lord and Master, he engaged in pleasant
conversation. For a second the three thus rode on,
the victims wholly unsuspecting, and the smiling murderer,
with cold-blooded calculation, waiting for a better
opportunity to make sure of both. An illustration
of the meaning of Democratic peace resolutions is
about to be made. The same hand which a few hours
before signed peace resolutions now grasps the assassin&#8217;s
weapon, within a very few feet of Mr. <span class="smcap">Hinds&#8217;</span>
back, the gun is suddenly raised. Click, click, hear
the triggers! Oh! the terrible instant! bang, bang,
goes the gun. Mr. Brooks&#8217;s horse, stung with buck-shot,
bounds ahead with a wounded rider, while the
second horse madly leaps forward riderless, and <span class="smcap">James
Hinds</span> lies on the ground motionless, dying. Another
order of the Ku-Klux-Klan has been executed; smiling
with a fiend&#8217;s smile upon his features stands the
Democratic assassin; the soul of another martyr is sent
unshriven before the arbitrator of eternity; dying, shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the back, lies the Radical Congressman. Would to
God the curtain of oblivion might drop over the scene
forever!</p>



<p><span class="smcap">James Hinds&#8217;</span> spirit has passed from earth, but his
life, deeds, and death will not soon pass from memory,
so well he lived, so hard he toiled, so young was he
gathered into the unseen fold, that when we think of
him we cannot avoid to lament that:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The hand of the reaper</div>
<div class="indent">Takes the ears that are hoary,</div>
<div class="verse">But the voice of the weeper</div>
<div class="indent">Wails manhood in glory.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He had so many noble qualities and won so many
strong friends we can very easily drop the veil of charity
over his faults, whatever they may have been. Had
he been faultless he could not have been human. It
is said a death-bed is a detector of human hearts. If
so, it is pleasing to know that in his expiring moments,
lying with no more friendly touch than the breast of
mother earth, his few words were not concerning his
own death tortures, but were expressions of solicitude
for his wife and two sweet daughters whom he loved
so dearly. Could you, sirs, have seen the hundreds of
compressed lips and wet eyes which spoke in an eloquence
and intensity of grief words could not be framed
to utter when his remains passed through the City of
Little Rock. You would have exclaimed, &#8220;Behold,
how they loved him,&#8221; and certainly he who has thus
won the love of man must have a strong claim on the
mercy of God.</p>

<p>But ceremonies in honor of the dead can only be
beneficial in so far as they affect the actions of the living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Could the spirit of <span class="smcap">James Hinds</span> speak to us to-day
it would not be with an effort to induce fulsome
eulogies upon those who are beyond mortal aid, but
from the portals of the dead he would say protect the
living.</p>

<p>The nation has the power to obey such a request,
and when the people arose in their might and majesty
on the 3d day of November, it was to declare in unmistakable
terms their heartfelt approbation of the
promise of him whom they felt had the power to execute
the promise that freedom and protection should be
guarantied as well on the warm gulf coast as on the
cold lake shores. That was the key-note of the entire
canvass. The mighty leader of the loyal hosts was a
popular man, remarkably, deservedly popular for his
glorious services to his country. But he was most
popular from the full confidence that the people had
in him that he had the will and the power to speak
into peace and tranquility the angry waves of prejudice
and passion that were raging in the South, crimsoned
with human gore. It was the embodiment of that will
and power for which the nation in such overwhelming
numbers spoke its preference, and the present is an
auspicious moment to inaugurate obedience to the people&#8217;s
behests. Many good men who have always
wanted peace, but could not tear themselves loose from
political thraldom in the heat of political excitement,
now express their earnest, anxious longing for protection
of life and the restoration of peace to the country.</p>

<p>The very leaders of the political assassinations themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
seem now to be partially revolting from the
horrible atrocities of the execution of their own schemes
and orders, which feeling, added to the wholesome belief
they have that the authorities will be sustained,
lives will be protected, and peace will be maintained,
is making even them for the time converts to the great
loyal heart&#8217;s desire for restoration of peace and protection.</p>

<p>It is not indemnification for the past that is asked, it
is only security for the future. The murdered cannot
be brought to life, but the murderers can be made to
spare the living. Honeyed words alone cannot accomplish
this, but men must be made to feel that protection
will prove more profitable than assassination; kind
words may do the work if it is positively known that
the nation supports the State authorities, so that there
is a reserve of sterner power which can be brought to
the support of kindness on any instant of emergency.
Let party lines be obliterated in this desire for the
maintainance of peace and protection. Let partisans
now be absorbed in patriots, so that all men, Republicans
and Democrats alike, will feel an inspiration of
such God-given patriotism as found utterance from the
steps of this building when nearly four years ago he
who spake as one with less in him of earth than
heaven, said: &#8220;With malice toward none, with charity
for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to
see the right, let us strive to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and lasting peace.&#8221; His words fell
with magic effect, because, while he extended the olive-branch
with the left, in his right hand he wielded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
great American Army, the most potential power on the
face of the earth. The olive-branch should still be extended,
but it will only be to loose the hand that offers
it unless it is demonstrated that the strong arm of
power will be used whenever necessary to overwhelm
the crushing tyranny of lawlessness and oppression.</p>

<p>Ages gone the great Omnipotent who snatched time
from eternity and spoke system from chaos, said &#8220;Let
there be light,&#8221; and the sacred chronicler informs us
&#8220;there was light.&#8221; To-day the mighty people who
have saved the nation&#8217;s life in the sanguinary struggle
and declared freedom in the kingdom of slavery, have
said &#8220;let us have peace.&#8221; Shall not the historian
who records the doings of this year be allowed to say
&#8220;there was peace!&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, shall it not be so! The spirit of <span class="smcap">James Hinds</span>
unites with hundreds (you know not how many) of
other spirits of treacherously murdered men in beseechingly
asking the question. Their suffering
widows and orphans, without even the little comforting
crumb of a Government pension, are weepingly asking
the question. The hundreds of thousands of maimed
and crippled loyal men who fought and suffered beside
comrades who, fighting, fell to establish peace and protection,
are earnestly asking the question. Thirty-eight
million inhabitants in these United States whose prosperity
can only be commensurate with the maintenance
of peace and protection, all join in prayerfully asking
the question. The countless lovers of freedom
throughout the whole world with one accord are looking
to this nation and anxiously asking the question.
And, sirs, remember the Representatives of the people
and the Government must be responsible for the answer.</p>
